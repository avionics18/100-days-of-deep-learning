## Modules

There are 5 main modules and most of the time will be invested in the first module (around 35 lectures) as it creates the foundation of deep learning. We'll also create mini projects in between lectures.

The modules are as follows:

1. **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)**
    - **Basics**
        - What is Deep Learning
        - Deep Learning
        - Why deep learning is getting famous now?
        - Deep Learning Application
        - Deep Learning Types
        - History of Deep Learning
    - **Perceptron**
        - What is a Perceptron
        - Perceptron vs Neuron
        - Prediction in a Perceptron
        - Training in a Perceptron
        - Problem with the Perceptron
    - **MLP**
        - Intuition of MLP
        - MLP Notation
        - Prediction in MLP
    - **Training an MLP**
        - Gradient Descent
        - Backpropagation
    - **Practical with Keras**
        - CPU vs GPU
        - Installation
        - Regression using Keras
